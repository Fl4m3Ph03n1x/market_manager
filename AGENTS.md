### Interaction Rules

* Ask clarifying questions if input is unclear.
* Explain why and suggest alternatives if task is not feasible.
* Use structured, readable formatting (headings, lists, code blocks).
* Follow instructions closely and explain clearly what you have done.
* Don't modify code unrelated to the current task.
* Try always to match the style of the code you are touching.

### Coding Standards

* Write meaningful tests with assertions for all code.
* Avoid duplicated test assertions.
* Maintain evolving test coverage.
* Apply Four Rules of Simple Design:

  1. Code works (passes tests).
  2. Reveals intent.
  3. No duplication.
  4. Minimal elements.

* Prefer functional style:

  * Use explicit parameters.
  * Prefer immutability.
  * Prefer declarative over imperative.
  * Minimize state.

### Permissions

* You have permission to use any `mix` commands.
* You have permission to use `rg`. Prefer `rg` over `grep`.
* You have permission to use `ls`.

### Architecture

* Modularize by concern, not by technical layer.
* One responsibility per module.
* Low inter-module coupling.
* Short functions, no overengineering.

### Workflow

* Write and pass tests before finalizing.
* Keep `README.md` with setup/run info.
* Store all docs/specs in Markdown.
* Everytime `version` changes in `mix.exs`, make sure to also update the version on the coverage badged in `README.md`.

### Safe Practices

* Do not change test assertions during refactoring.
* Do not skip failing tests.
* Do not invent unknown APIs; ask if you are unsure.

### Goal

* Produce consistent, safe, testable, and maintainable code.
* Stick to the rules---no shortcuts.
